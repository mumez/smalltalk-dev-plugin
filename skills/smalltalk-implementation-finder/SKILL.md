# Smalltalk Implementation Finder

Find and analyze method implementations across class hierarchies to understand abstract methods, implementation patterns, and assess refactoring opportunities.

## Purpose

Use this skill to:
- **Learn implementation idioms** by studying existing code
- **Assess refactoring impact** before making changes
- **Discover implementation patterns** across class hierarchies
- **Find duplicate implementations** that could be consolidated
- **Understand subclass responsibilities** for abstract methods

## Core Workflow

```
1. Find implementors → search_implementors(method_name)
2. Get source code → get_method_source(class, method)
3. Analyze patterns → Compare implementations
4. Apply learnings → Use discovered idioms in your code
```

## Primary Use Cases

### 1. Learning Implementation Idioms

**When to use**: Implementing a method for the first time and want to follow conventions.

**Quick workflow**:
```
1. search_implementors("methodName")
2. Sample 5-10 well-known classes
3. get_method_source for each
4. Identify common pattern
5. Apply to your implementation
```

**Common idioms**:
- `hash` → Combine fields with `bitXor:`
- `initialize` → Call `super initialize` first
- `=` → Check class equality, then compare fields
- `printOn:` → Use class identifier + element printing

**Example**: Learning hash implementation
```
Point>>hash → "^ x hash bitXor: y hash"
Association>>hash → "^ key hash bitXor: value hash"

Pattern: field1 hash bitXor: field2 hash
```

### 2. Assessing Refactoring Impact

**When to use**: Planning to change a method signature or refactor implementations.

**Quick workflow**:
```
1. Count implementors: search_implementors(method)
2. Count references: search_references(method)
3. Assess impact: Low (<5 impl, <20 refs) / Medium (5-20, 20-100) / High (20+, 100+)
4. Decide: Proceed / Add new method / Don't change
```

**Example**: Changing `at:put:`
```
Implementors: 50+ classes
References: 500+ call sites
Impact: VERY HIGH
Decision: Don't change. Add new method instead.
```

### 3. Finding Duplicate Code

**When to use**: Suspect multiple classes have identical implementations.

**Quick workflow**:
```
1. Find implementors in same hierarchy
2. Get source for each
3. Compare for duplicates
4. Refactor identical code to superclass
```

**Example**: Consolidating `isEmpty`
```
Array>>isEmpty → "^ self size = 0"
Set>>isEmpty → "^ self size = 0"
OrderedCollection>>isEmpty → "^ self size = 0"

Action: Pull up to Collection superclass
```

### 4. Understanding Abstract Methods

**When to use**: Encountering `self subclassResponsibility` and need to see concrete implementations.

**Quick workflow**:
```
1. Check abstract definition in superclass
2. Find all implementors
3. Study 3-5 concrete implementations
4. Understand expected behavior
```

**Example**: Understanding `Collection>>do:`
```
Collection>>do: → "self subclassResponsibility"
Array>>do: → "1 to: self size do: [:i | aBlock value: (self at: i)]"
LinkedList>>do: → "[node notNil] whileTrue: [aBlock value: node value. ...]"

Understanding: Each uses its own iteration strategy
```

### 5. Narrowing Usage Search

**When to use**: Finding references to a specific class's implementation, not all implementations.

**Quick workflow**:
```
1. Find implementors
2. Find all references
3. Filter by receiver type/context
4. Focus on relevant usage
```

**Example**: Finding `Collection>>select:` usage (not `Dictionary>>select:`)
```
Implementors: [Collection, Dictionary, Interval, ...]
References: 1000+ call sites

Filter by variable context:
  "myArray select: [...]" → Collection implementation
  "myDict select: [...]" → Dictionary implementation
```

## MCP Tools

### search_implementors
```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__search_implementors: 'methodName'
```
Returns all classes implementing the method.

### get_method_source
```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__get_method_source: class: 'ClassName' method: 'methodName'
```
Gets source code for a specific implementation.

### eval (for hierarchy exploration)
```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__eval: 'Collection allSubclasses'
```
Useful for scoping analysis to specific hierarchies.

### search_references
```
mcp__smalltalk-interop__search_references: 'methodName'
```
Finds all senders (combines well with implementor analysis).

## Quick Reference

| Goal | Tools | Pattern |
|------|-------|---------|
| Learn idiom | search_implementors → get_method_source | Sample 5-10, identify pattern |
| Assess impact | search_implementors + search_references | Count both, assess risk |
| Find duplicates | search_implementors → get_method_source | Compare, find identical |
| Narrow usage | search_implementors → search_references | Filter by receiver type |

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- **Scope by hierarchy**: Focus on relevant class hierarchies using `eval("ClassA allSubclasses")`
- **Sample wisely**: Choose well-known, well-implemented classes (Array, Dictionary, Point)
- **Count first**: Get overview before analyzing 500+ implementations
- **Check super**: Understand inherited behavior

### ❌ Don't

- Analyze all implementors without filtering
- Use obscure classes as examples
- Ignore superclass implementations
- Assume same method name = same behavior

## Common Workflows

### Workflow: Implement Abstract Method
```
Problem: Need to implement printOn: in new class

1. search_implementors("printOn:")
2. Filter to similar classes
3. get_method_source for 3-5 examples
4. Identify pattern
5. Apply to your class
```

### Workflow: Assess Refactoring
```
Problem: Want to change at:put: signature

1. search_implementors("at:put:") → Count implementations
2. search_references("at:put:") → Count call sites
3. Assess impact (High/Medium/Low)
4. Decide: Change / Add new / Don't change
```

### Workflow: Find Duplication
```
Problem: Suspect duplicate isEmpty implementations

1. search_implementors("isEmpty")
2. Focus on Collection hierarchy
3. get_method_source for subclasses
4. Compare for identical code
5. Refactor to superclass if identical
```

- **[Implementation Scenarios](examples/implementation-scenarios.md)** - Real-world examples including implementing abstract methods, assessing refactoring impact, finding duplicate code, learning idioms, and understanding template method patterns

## Summary

**Key principle**: Implementations across a hierarchy reveal design patterns and idioms. Use them to write better, more idiomatic code.

**Primary workflow**: Find implementors → Get source → Analyze patterns → Apply learnings

**Remember**: Always scope your analysis to relevant hierarchies and representative classes to avoid information overload.
